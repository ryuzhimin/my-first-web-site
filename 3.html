<p>If I ever have to leave, where would I go?
Should I really have to leave?
Where do you think I should be?
You know I always wanna be
Somewhere or anywhere that near by you
I wanna make this love clearly
Make it more longer, make it more stronger
And I wish we'll be together
When life makes us apart and tears us apart
You're the poet in my heart
The changes in my mind, pounding in my heart
You're everything in my head
You're the dreams I've always wished
A chance to be better
Flowers in my path, my love
I know you always try so hard
Whenever or where we are, you're near by me
I know we always love so deep
Made it for long time, let's make it last longer
And I wish we'll be together
When life makes us apart and tears us apart
You're the poet in my heart
The changes in my mind, pounding in my heart
You're everything in my head
You're the dreams I've always wished
A chance to be better
Flowers in my path, my love
Too many ups and downs
We have been through together, above love
You are more than my everything
To me, oh, you are, hmm
You're the poet in my heart
The changes in my mind, pounding in my heart
You're everything in my head
You're the dreams I've always wished
A chance to be better
Flowers in my path, my love
You're the poet in my heart
The changes in my mind, pounding in my heart
You're everything in my head
You're the dreams I've always wished
A chance to be better
Flowers in my path, my love</p>
